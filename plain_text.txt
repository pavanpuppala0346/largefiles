Flat file database vs. relational database
A flat file is often mistaken for a relational database, but they are actually much different. 
A flat file consists of a single table of data. It allows the user to specify data attributes, such as columns and data types table by table,
and stores those attributes separate from applications. This type of file is commonly used to import data in data warehousing projects.
In relational databases, flat file is sometimes used as a synonym for a "relation." A relational database contains multiple tables of data that
relate to each other and allows the user to specify information about multiple tables and the relationships between those tables, 
allowing more flexibility and control over database constraints.
